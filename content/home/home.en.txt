Subheadline: Character Creator and Manager for TDE 5th Edition

Text: Optolith is a tool to create and manage characters for the Pen & Paper RPG *The Dark Eye* (5th Edition) by Ulisses Spiele. If you use Optolith, you don't have to worry anymore if you follow all the rules -- because it does it for you! It also offers you a clear user interface, you can use it both with the mouse and touch, and it can display rules and crunch texts while you create or edit a hero. So you can concentrate on the essentials of hero creation and management: The heroes themselves.
