## Responsible for content

Although the content of these webpages has been created with utmost care, we assume no liability for it being correct, complete or up-to-date. According to Art. 7 para 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act), we, as a service provider, are responsible for our own content on these webpages in accordance with general legislation. However, according to Art. 8-10 TMG, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or saved external information or to investigate circumstances that may constitute illegal activities. This does not affect our obligation to remove or restrict access to information in accordance with the generally applicable laws. We will delete such content immediately upon becoming aware of any rights infringements.

## Liability for links

Our own website contains links to external websites whose content we have no control or influence over. We therefore assume no liability for such content. The provider or operator of the linked pages is solely responsible for the content of those pages. The linked pages were checked for any potential infringements at the time that the link was created and no illegal content was discovered. Without being made aware of an infringement, we cannot reasonably be expected to monitor the content continuously. We will delete the corresponding links immediately upon becoming aware of any rights violations.

## Copyright

The content of these webpages is subject to German copyright law. It may only be reproduced, edited, translated, distributed or used beyond the scope of the copyright with written permission from the corresponding author or creator. Furthermore, this website may only be copied or downloaded for non-commercial or personal use. If this website contains content that was not created by the operator, the copyrights relating to this content have been respected. Third-party content is identified accordingly. However, if you believe there may be an infringement of copyright, please inform us and we will delete such content immediately.

## Data protection

Our website can generally be used without having to provide personal information. If personal data such as your name, address or e-mail address is collected on our webpages, you provide this information voluntarily, unless specified otherwise. We will not share this data with third parties without your express consent.

We expressly point out that there may be security vulnerabilities when transferring data online or electronically (such as when communicating by e-mail). As a result, such data cannot be protected completely against being accessed by third parties.

Contact details published as part of providing the disclosure information may not be used by third parties to transmit advertising or other information that has not been expressly requested. The operators of the webpages expressly reserve the right to take legal action if unsolicited promotional information is sent (e.g. in the form of 'spam').

## Right to information; correction, blocking, deletion of data

You have the right to be informed (free of charge) at any time of the data being held about you, its origin and recipient and the purpose for which it is used, as well as the right to such data being corrected, blocked or deleted. If you have any questions about personal data, you can contact us at the address stated in the Legal Disclosure.

The provider of the webpages automatically collects information that your browser transmits to us and stores it in log files. This information comprises:

- Visited webpage

- Amount of sent data in bytes
- Referrer URL
- Browser type/version

This data cannot be associated with specific people. The data is not combined with data from other sources. We reserve the right to check this data retroactively if we have specific reason to believe that it is being used unlawfully.
