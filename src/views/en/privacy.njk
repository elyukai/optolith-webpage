<h2>Responsible for content</h2>
<p>
  Although the content of these webpages has been created with utmost care, we assume no liability for it being correct, complete or up-to-date. According to Art. 7 para 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act), we, as a service provider, are responsible for our own content on these webpages in accordance with general legislation. However, according to Art. 8-10 TMG, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or saved external information or to investigate circumstances that may constitute illegal activities. This does not affect our obligation to remove or restrict access to information in accordance with the generally applicable laws. We will delete such content immediately upon becoming aware of any rights infringements.

<h2>Liability for links</h2>
<p>
  Our own website contains links to external websites whose content we have no control or influence over. We therefore assume no liability for such content. The provider or operator of the linked pages is solely responsible for the content of those pages. The linked pages were checked for any potential infringements at the time that the link was created and no illegal content was discovered. Without being made aware of an infringement, we cannot reasonably be expected to monitor the content continuously. We will delete the corresponding links immediately upon becoming aware of any rights violations.

However, if you believe there may be an infringement of copyright, please inform us and we will delete such content immediately.
